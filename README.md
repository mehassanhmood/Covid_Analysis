## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the world. This EDA project aims to analyze and visualize COVID-19 data to gain insights into its spread and impact. We start with a global overview and then focus on the situation in the United States.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data**: Two Data sources were utilized one a snapshot at a time and point and another which is time series
- **notebook**: Jupyter notebook used for data analysis and visualization.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Data Sources

We have used data from the following sources:

- [COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

## Requirements

The project was developed using Python and the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- plotly
- folium
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these libraries using pip:
